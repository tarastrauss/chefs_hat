- As a user, I can upload a picture of the completed food.

- As a user, I can view and edit my profile as well as look at other people's profiles.

####Ice Box

- As a user, I can choose what type of food I am making (appetizer, dessert, main course, etc.)

- As a user, I see the recipes in my hat organized by type (appetizer, dessert, etc.)

- As a user, when I add a recipe I can choose from drop down menus of specific ingredients and portions, or I can choose an unconventional ingredient or portion.

- As a user, when I add a recipe I can choose from cute graphics of specific ingredients instead of a drop down/text menu.

###Technologies Used

Chef's Hat will be created using Ruby on Rails, with a Postgres database that uses active record methods. HTML will be used along with bootstrap and original CSS to style. Images will be uploaded using paperclip and stored using Amazon Web Services. Pry will be used in development for troubleshooting.

###Design

The design will be simple, gender-neutral and fun. A simple yellow background will be used. Default images will be google clipart labeled for resuse.

The login page will be simple with only the name of the site, the tagline and a place to login or sign up:
